## Introduction:

In this blog post, I will delve deep into the realms of development, specifically on a project that was developed four years ago - JetScan, 3D scanner that uses the Nvidia Jetson board and Intel Realsense. This is not your usual technical analysis of the project, more of examining the mindset, motivations, and thought processes that went into its creation.

### Section 1: The Genesis of JetScan

This section will explore the initial conceptualization of JetScan. Discuss why you chose to create a 3D scanner, why you decided on the Nvidia Jetson board and Intel Realsense, and what problem you aimed to solve. Reflect on your initial expectations and motivations.

### Section 2: Design and Development Phase

In this section, discuss the development process of JetScan. What were the challenges you encountered? How did your mindset influence the way you solved these problems? Reflect on the psychological aspects behind these decisions.

### Section 3: Launch and Reception

Reflect on your feelings during the launch of JetScan. How did it feel to see your project come to life? Discuss any feedback or reactions you received and how they impacted you emotionally and psychologically.

### Section 4: Looking Back

With the benefit of hindsight, what would you have done differently? Reflect on any changes in your thought processes, perspectives, and skills over the past four years. How have these changes influenced your perspective on the JetScan project?

### Section 5: Lessons Learned

Discuss the valuable lessons learned from the project and how they have influenced your subsequent projects. Reflect on any psychological growth or shifts in mindset that occurred as a result of working on JetScan.

### Conclusion:

Summarize the main points of your psychoanalysis and the insights you have gained from this reflective process. Encourage readers to undertake similar analyses of their past projects, emphasizing the value of such a reflective exercise.

Remember, the purpose of this blog post is not only to explore the technical aspects of your project but to delve deeper into the psychological aspects of your development process. It's about understanding the 'why' behind your decisions and the emotional journey that accompanies the creation of a project like JetScan.
